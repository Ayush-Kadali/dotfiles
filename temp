If it works for other repositories, but not one in particular, then you are probably using the wrong remote url(i.e. https instead of git@github.com)

First, double check that your git ssh connection is working:

 ssh -T git@github.com
If it works, check your remote:

 git remote -v
it will display something like this:

 origin  https://github.com/ownername/repo(fetch)
 origin  https://github.com/ownername/repo(push)
where ownername is either your username or your organization name (the "owner" of the repository).

If the remotes indicate https at the beginning, then you need to change this url with:

 git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ownername/repo.git
